#Description:
#1-Write a Python program that prints a "flattened" version of a list that contains nested lists.
#2-"Flattened" means that all the elements in the nested lists should be added to a main list such that it doesn't contain any nested lists, just the individual.
#3-The list could contain other elements that are not lists or other sequences, so you must check the type of each element and act appropriately.
#4-If the list is empty, print an empty list.

list_a=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
for i in list_a:
    print(i)
